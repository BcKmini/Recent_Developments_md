## 요약
OpenAI is updating its Model Spec with new Under-18 Principles that define how ChatGPT should support teens with safe, age-appropriate guidance grounded in developmental science. The update strengthens guardrails, clarifies expected model behavior in higher-risk situations, and builds on our broader work to improve teen safety across ChatGPT.
