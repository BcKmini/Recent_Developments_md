# Technical Report: Performance and baseline evaluations of gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b

**출처:** [OpenAI_Blog](https://openai.com/index/gpt-oss-safeguard-technical-report)

## 요약
gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b are two open-weight reasoning models post-trained from the gpt-oss models and trained to reason from a provided policy in order to label content under that policy. In this report, we describe gpt-oss-safeguard’s capabilities and provide our baseline safety evaluations on the gpt-oss-safeguard models, using the underlying gpt-oss models as a baseline. For more information about the development and architecture of the underlying gpt-oss models, see the original gpt-oss model model card⁠.
