## 요약
GPT-5.2 is OpenAI’s strongest model yet for math and science, setting new state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like GPQA Diamond and FrontierMath. This post shows how those gains translate into real research progress, including solving an open theoretical problem and generating reliable mathematical proofs.
