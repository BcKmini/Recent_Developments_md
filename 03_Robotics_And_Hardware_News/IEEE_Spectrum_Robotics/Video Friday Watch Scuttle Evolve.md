##### [ICRA 2026](https://2026.ieee-icra.org/): 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA

Enjoy today’s videos!

I always love seeing robots [progress from research projects to commercial products](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ground-control-robot-insects).

[ [Ground Control Robotics](https://groundcontrolrobotics.com/) ]

Well this has to be one of the most “watch a robot do this task entirely through the magic of jump cuts” I’ve ever seen.

[ [UBTECH](https://www.ubtrobot.com/en/) ]

Very satisfying sound on this one.

> *Welcome to the AgileX Robotics Data Collection Facility, where real robots build the foundation for universal embodied intelligence. Our core mission? Enable large-scale data sharing and reuse across dual-arm teleoperation robots of diverse morphologies, breaking down data silos that slow down AI progress.*

I’m not sure how much thought was put into this, but giving a service robot an explicit cat face could be a good way of moderating expectations on its behavior and interactivity.

UBTECH says they have built 1,000 of their [Walker S2 humanoid robots](https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-baseball-robot), over 500 of which are “delivered & working.” I would very much like to know what “working” means in this context.

> *Every story has its beginning, and ours started in 2023—a year defined by the unknown. Let technology return to passion; let trials catalyze evolution. Embracing growth, embarking on a new journey. We’ll see you at the next stop.*

Please, please hire someone to do some HRI (human-robot interface) design.
