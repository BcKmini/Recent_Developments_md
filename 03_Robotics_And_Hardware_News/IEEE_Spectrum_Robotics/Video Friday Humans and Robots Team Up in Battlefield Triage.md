Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at *IEEE Spectrum* robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please [send us your events](mailto:automaton@ieee.org?subject=Robotics%20event%20suggestion%20for%20Video%20Friday) for inclusion.

##### [ICRA 2026](https://2026.ieee-icra.org/): 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA

Enjoy today’s videos!

One of my favorite parts of robotics is watching research collide with non-roboticists in the real (or real-ish) world.

Spot will [put out fires](https://spectrum.ieee.org/wildfire-drones) for you. Eventually. If it feels like it.

[ [Mechatronic and Robotic Systems Laboratory](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/letterstransrobotics/article-abstract/1/3/031004/1229384/Development-of-an-Autonomous-Firefighting?redirectedFrom=fulltext) ]

All those robots rising out of their crates is not sinister at all.

> *The Lynx M20 quadruped robot recently completed an extreme cold-weather field test in Yakeshi, Hulunbuir, operating reliably in temperatures as low as –30°C.*

[ [DEEP Robotics](https://www.deeprobotics.cn/en) ]

> *This is a teaser video for KIMLAB’s new teleoperation robot. For now, we invite you to enjoy the calm atmosphere, with students walking, gathering, and chatting across the UIUC Main Quad—along with its scenery and ambient sounds, without any technical details. More details will be shared soon. Enjoy the moment.*

The most incredible part of this video is that they have publicly available power in the middle of their quad.

For the eleventy billionth time: just because you can do a task with a [humanoid robot](https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robots), doesn’t mean you should do a task with a humanoid robot.

[ [UBTECH](https://www.ubtrobot.com/en/) ]

I am less interested in this autonomous urban delivery robot and more interested in whatever that docking station is at the beginning that loads the box into it.

[ [KAIST](https://unmanned.kaist.ac.kr/) ]

Ok so figuring out where [Spot’s face](https://spectrum.ieee.org/spot-is-boston-dynamics-nimble-new-quadruped-robot) is just got a lot more complicated.

[ [Boston Dynamics](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/a-new-perspective-for-facilities-inspection/) ]

> *An undergraduate team at HKU’s Tam Wing Fan Innovation Wing developed CLIO, an embodied tour-guide robot, just in months. Built on LimX Dynamics TRON 1, it uses LLMs for tour planning, computer vision for visitor recognition, and a laser pointer/expressive display for engaging tours.*

The future of work is doing work so that robots can then do the same work except less well.
