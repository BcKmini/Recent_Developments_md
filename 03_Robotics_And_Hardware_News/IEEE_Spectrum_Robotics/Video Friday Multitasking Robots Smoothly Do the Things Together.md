Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at *IEEE Spectrum* robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please [send us your events](mailto:automaton@ieee.org?subject=Robotics%20event%20suggestion%20for%20Video%20Friday) for inclusion.

##### [ICRA 2026](https://2026.ieee-icra.org/): 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA

Enjoy this week’s videos!

> *Westwood Robotics is proud to announce a major update: THEMIS Gen2.5, the world’s first commercial full-size humanoid robot capable of manipulation on the move!*

Now that you mention it, the bit at the end where the robot picks up a can while walking? I haven’t seen a lot of that.

> *Last year, Helix showed that a single neural network could control a humanoid’s upper body from pixels. Today, Helix 02 extends that control to the entire robot—walking, manipulating, and balancing as one continuous system.*

Why, yes, I am a normal human, and this is very similar to the default state of my kitchen.

> *[Harry Goldstein](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-spectrum-wins-11-awards), our editor in chief, went to meet Sprout from Fauna Robotics. He was skeptical at first, but Sprout won him over with its robotic charm.*

> *Kimberly Elenberg is showing how the data collected by [robotic responders](https://spectrum.ieee.org/darpa-triage-challenge-robots) can save lives in mass casualty events.*

The educational robotics market is tough, but you’ve got to hand it to [Sphero](https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-robots-of-ces)—going strong since 2011, which is pretty incredible.

> *If you want to fly in crazy conditions, you have to [flight test](https://spectrum.ieee.org/photo-essay-tornados-and-frisky-birds-couldnt-stop-these-delivery-drones) in those conditions. Here’s how and why we do it!*

I want to be impressed more by the idea of 3D-printing skin and skeleton at the same time, but come on, animals have been doing that for literally hundreds of years without even trying.

If there is a market for small bipedal robots that can both ski and be dinosaurs, LimX has it covered.

> *How do you remotely control robots that change shape? We introduce a method for user-guided control of [modular robots](https://spectrum.ieee.org/epfl-developing-connectors-for-modular-floating-robots) using reconfigurable joint-space joysticks (JoJo) and real-time optimization. We demonstrate this system on two different robots, Mori3 and Roombots. The video shows examples of these robots performing object manipulation, locomotion, human-assistance, and reconfiguration, controlled by our system.*

> *Quadrotor Biplane Tailsitter (QBiT) UAVs at four different sizes (4, 12, 25, and 50 lbs) developed at Texas A&M University. QBiT combines the mechanical simplicity of a quadrotor drone with the cruise efficiency of a fixed-wing aircraft.*

There’s a new DARPA challenge for “novel drone designs that can carry payloads more than four times their weight, which would revolutionize the way we use drones across all sectors.”

Here are a couple of plenary and keynote talks from IROS 2025, from [Marco Hutter](https://spectrum.ieee.org/marco-hutter-ai-institute) and [Karinne Ramirez Amaro](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-society-boosting-student-membership).
