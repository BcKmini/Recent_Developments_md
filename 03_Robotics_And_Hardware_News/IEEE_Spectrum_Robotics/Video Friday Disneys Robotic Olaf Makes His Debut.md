Enjoy today’s videos!

> *Step behind the scenes with Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development and discover how Disney uses robotics, AI, and immersive technology to bring stories to life! From the brand new self-walking Olaf in World of Frozen and BDX Droids to cutting-edge attractions like Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, see how magic meets innovation.*

> *We just released a new demonstration of Mentee’s V3 humanoid robots completing a real world logistics task together. Over an uninterrupted 18-minute run, the robots autonomously move 32 boxes from eight piles to storage racks of different heights. The video shows steady locomotion, dexterous manipulation, and reliable coordination throughout the entire task.*

And there’s an uncut 18 minute version of this at the link.

Thanks, Yovav!

> *This video contains graphic depictions of simulated injuries. Viewer discretion is advised.**In this immersive overview, guided by the [DARPA Triage Challenge](https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-darpa-triage-challenge) program manager, retired Army Col. Jeremy C. Pamplin, M.D., you’ll experience how teams of innovators, engineers, and DARPA are redefining the future of combat casualty care. Be sure to look all around! Check out competition runs, behind-the-scenes of what it takes to put on a DARPA Challenge, and glimpses into the future of lifesaving care.*

Those couple of minutes starting at 6:50 with the human medic and robotic teaming was particularly cool.

You don’t need to build a humanoid robot if you can just make existing humanoids a lot better.

I especially love 0:45 because you know what? Humanoids should spend more time sitting down, for all kinds of reasons. And of course, thank you for falling and getting up again, albeit on some of the squishiest grass on the planet.

“Human-in-the-Loop Gaussian Splatting” wins best paper title of the week.

[ [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11248882) ] via [ *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters* in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7083369) ]

Scratch that, “Extremum Seeking Controlled Wiggling for Tactile Insertion” wins best paper title of the week.

The battery swapping on this thing is... Unfortunate.

> *To push the boundaries of robotic capability, researchers in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in collaboration with The University of Washington and Google Deepmind, have developed a new tactile sensing system that enables four-legged robots to carry unsecured, cylindrical objects on their backs. This system, known as LocoTouch, features a network of [tactile sensors](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robot-facebook) that spans the robot’s entire back. As an object shifts, the sensors provide real-time feedback on its position, allowing the robot to continuously adjust its posture and movement to keep the object balanced.*

This robot is in more need of googly eyes than any other robot I’ve ever seen.

> *DPR Construction has deployed Field AI’s autonomy software on a quadruped robot at the company’s job site in Santa Clara, CA, to greatly improve its daily surveying and data collection processes. By automating what has traditionally been a very labor intensive and time consuming process, Field AI is helping the DPR team operate more efficiently and effectively, while increasing project quality.*

> *In our second episode of AI in Motion, our host, Waymo AI researcher Vincent Vanhoucke, talks with a robotics startup founder Sergey Levine, who left a career in academic research to build better robots for the home and workplace.*
