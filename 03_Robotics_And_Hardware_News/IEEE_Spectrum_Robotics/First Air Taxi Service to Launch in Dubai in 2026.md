Summary
-------

* Joby Aviation is realizing Uber’s original “Elevate” dream, moving electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft from science fiction toward commercial reality.
* By 2026, [Joby aims to inaugurate the world’s first integrated air taxi network](https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/topic/robotics.rss#joby)—in Dubai—leveraging aggressive local infrastructure investment to bypass Western bureaucratic hurdles.
* [The plan includes “vertiports” at strategic hubs like Dubai International Airport](https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/topic/robotics.rss#agreement), creating the essential physical and digital ecosystem required for reliable point-to-point urban flight.
* [While facing a cautious FAA in the U.S.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/topic/robotics.rss#groundwork), Joby will use its Dubai operations to bridge the gap between experimental testing and full-scale passenger operations.

**Ten years ago,** ride-sharing giant [Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/) embraced a sci-fi future in which clean, quiet electric aircraft would shuttle passengers around crowded cities. Uber’s well-funded Elevate initiative, which included [a white paper](https://evtol.news/__media/PDFs/UberElevateWhitePaperOct2016.pdf) and three high-profile annual summits, effectively launched the electric vertical take-off and landing [(eVTOL) industry](https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-aircraft), promising investors, regulators, and the general public that these futuristic flying taxis were “[closer than you think](https://youtu.be/JuWOUEFB_IQ).”

At the time, California-based [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/) was still in stealth mode. But behind the scenes, this pioneering eVTOL developer—which has received more than US $3 billion in total funding, including [around $900 million from Toyota](https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/toyota-to-invest-500-million-in-joby-aviation/)—was playing a major role in shaping Uber’s vision. It later stepped in to keep that vision alive, [acquiring the Elevate program](https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-aviation-welcomes-new-75m-investment-from-uber-as-it-acquires-uber-elevate-and-expands-partnership/) in 2020 after Uber CEO [Dara Khosrowshahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Khosrowshahi) decided to axe it.

Now, Joby, which was founded in 2009 and has become the dominant eVTOL startup, says it is finally on the verge of making “urban air mobility” a reality. It plans to conduct its first passenger flights in 2026 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

This article is part of our special report [Top Tech 2026](https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026).

“Dubai continues to be our global launchpad for commercial service, and our progress here is a testament to the UAE’s visionary approach to advanced air mobility,” says [Anthony Khoury](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antokho/?originalSubdomain=ae), Joby’s UAE general manager, in an email interview. “Dubai is on track to be the first city in the world to offer a fully integrated, premium air taxi network, and we are sprinting toward that target.”

Joby Struck a Six-Year Exclusive Deal with Dubai
------------------------------------------------

The company first [announced its UAE plans](https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-to-launch-air-taxi-service-uae/) at the World Governments Summit in Dubai in February 2024, striking a deal with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that gives it an exclusive right to operate air taxis there for six years from the launch of commercial operations.

Joby also signed an agreement with U.K.-based [Skyports](https://skyports.net/) to design, build, and operate four “[vertiport](https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-2661135407)” sites in Dubai—places for the eVTOL aircraft to load and unload passengers and charge their batteries. The first vertiport will be near Dubai International Airport, with additional ones planned for Dubai Mall, the Atlantis the Royal resort, and American University in Dubai.

Joby won’t be the first eVTOL developer to carry passengers. That distinction goes to China’s EHang, which is already conducting limited sightseeing and [demonstration flights](https://www.ehang.com/news/1275.html) with its two-seat, autonomous electric multicopters. (Joby’s aircraft are piloted.) If Joby pulls off its goal, however, it will be the first to routinely fly passengers from point to point over urban traffic, in keeping with Uber Elevate’s original vision. Its exclusive agreement in Dubai will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis, which includes a handful of other Western eVTOL developers, plus a growing number of Chinese players. Besides its Dubai deal, Joby also has a partnership with Delta to start an airport shuttle service in the United States.

Operating a reliable air taxi service is a demanding proposition that will require Joby’s aircraft, charging infrastructure, and scheduling software to perform safely and reliably day in and day out. Since every new and complex technology has teething problems, Joby envisions fairly limited initial operations in 2026.

“We will transition from test flights to more complex proving runs and eventually nonpaying passenger flights out of the completed vertiports, ensuring a seamless passenger experience ahead of full commercial launch,” says Khoury. He adds that Joby is currently working with Skyports to ready its initial vertiports and with government agencies in Dubai and the UAE to receive the necessary approvals for its operations.

“Dubai’s approach is deeper and more comprehensive than what you see in many of the headlines,” said Clint Harper, an aviation infrastructure and policy advisor who recently participated in an advanced air mobility workshop with Dubai’s RTA. “In our workshop,” he says, “the RTA staff had fantastic questions and concerns regarding safety, security, and system-level integration. Everyone recognized and appreciated strong government support and wanted to deliver the right system solution, not just a one-off demo. I was thoroughly impressed and inspired.”

Initial Air Operations Will Precede an Airworthiness Certificate
----------------------------------------------------------------

Notably, all of this groundwork is taking place in advance of Joby receiving an initial type certificate for its aircraft from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In the United States (and elsewhere), a type certificate is typically a prerequisite for conducting commercial operations with paying passengers. Joby claims it’s making good progress toward FAA certification, but how quickly (or slowly) that process moves is largely out of its hands. In recent years, the FAA has been taking longer to certify even conventional airplanes and helicopters, which the industry blames on staffing shortages at the agency and more cautious decision-making in the wake of the [Boeing 737 Max crisis](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-plea-737-max-crashes-b34daa014406657e720bec4a990dccf6).

This perception that certification delays have more to do with bureaucracy than safety may be why Dubai is willing to approve some early operations by Joby in advance of FAA type certification. Interestingly, the United States is now following the UAE’s example. In September, the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation began soliciting proposals for an [eVTOL Integration Pilot Program](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-new-plan-fast-track-advanced-air) (eIPP), which will select at least five projects to demonstrate eVTOL operations in the national airspace starting as early as summer 2026.

The FAA has [stated](https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-policy/trump-executive-order-drones-will-shape-us-evtol-roll-out/) that the eIPP won’t allow eVTOL developers to bypass certification requirements or carry paying passengers. However, it will enable them to undertake additional testing and demonstration flights as a stepping-stone to commercial operations. Joby says it’s [planning to take part](https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-plans-to-jumpstart-us-operations-through-eipp/) in the eIPP, meaning its air taxis could also be flying over U.S. cities in 2026—even if the only person on board is the pilot.
