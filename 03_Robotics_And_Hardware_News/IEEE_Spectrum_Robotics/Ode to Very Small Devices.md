As fairies for the Irish or leeks for Welsh,  
it’s the secret lives of small hidden machines,  
their junctures, and networks that inspire me:  
Mystic hidden functionaries that make  
our made world live, brave little servo motors,  
whose couplers, whose eccentric fire-filled  
sensors are encased in bakelite with brass  
screws, who stare with red eyes, who gauge moisture,  
who notice tiny motions and respond,  
whose cooling fans call out in white-noise  
registers like older folk singers–I can  
almost hear their earlier songs, their strong voices  
now yelps, their thumps, their throbs, their hum, their chant–,  
they click, they whir, they are sent spinning  
inside like teen girls giggling over boy bands.  
Most of all: ones waiting silently, concealing  
the surprise of their purpose, tasks not yet known,  
their true natures found only in connections.

Those that listen, those that speak,  
those that control cool and heat,  
those that open doors, those that lock  
all the things that we’ve forgot,  
those that hide, those that disclose  
those embedded in our clothes  
those in our ears, those in our hearts  
those that bring together, those a part  
of divisions, those like birds,  
like parrots that complete our words,  
those like fish, those that entrap,  
those that free, those that freely flap  
in fierce winds, those that replace  
what we have lost, those that see  
at night, in fog, in brightness, in fear,  
those that show what we hold dear,  
those that tempt, those that repel,  
those that buy and those that sell,  
those that keep us alive, those that  
don’t, won’t, couldn’t and cannot.

Parts of one mind, not mine, blunt orchestra  
of information, bundles of feelers  
reaching out to touch us, teach us, guide us  
to form better futures better understood.  
May your sounds, your chimes, your silence calm us.  
May your tender tendrils touch what we seek.  
Small parts becoming one being intertwined,  
a world in itself, remind us to be kind.
