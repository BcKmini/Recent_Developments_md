Abstract: This extended abstract details our solution for the Global Wheat Full Semantic Segmentation Competition. We developed a systematic self-training framework. This framework combines a two-stage hybrid training strategy with extensive data augmentation. Our core model is SegFormer with a Mix Transformer (MiT-B4) backbone. We employ an iterative teacher-student loop. This loop progressively refines model accuracy. It also maximizes data utilization. Our method achieved competitive performance. This was evident on both the Development and Testing Phase datasets.
