Abstract: Rapid motorization in emerging economies such as India has created severe enforcement asymmetries, with over 11 million recorded violations in 2023 against a human policing density of roughly one officer per 4000 vehicles. Traditional surveillance and manual ticketing cannot scale to this magnitude, motivating the need for an autonomous, cooperative, and energy efficient edge AI perception infrastructure. This paper presents a real time roadside perception node for multi class traffic violation analytics and safety event dissemination within a connected and intelligent vehicle ecosystem. The node integrates YOLOv8 Nano for high accuracy multi object detection, DeepSORT for temporally consistent vehicle tracking, and a rule guided OCR post processing engine capable of recognizing degraded or multilingual license plates compliant with MoRTH AIS 159 and ISO 7591 visual contrast standards. Deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with a 128 core Maxwell GPU and optimized via TensorRT FP16 quantization, the system sustains 28 to 30 frames per second inference at 9.6 W, achieving 97.7 percent violation detection accuracy and 84.9 percent OCR precision across five violation classes, namely signal jumping, zebra crossing breach, wrong way driving, illegal U turn, and speeding, without manual region of interest calibration. Comparative benchmarking against YOLOv4 Tiny, PP YOLOE S, and Nano DetPlus demonstrates a 10.7 percent mean average precision gain and a 1.4 times accuracy per watt improvement. Beyond enforcement, the node publishes standardized safety events of CAM and DENM type to connected vehicles and intelligent transportation system backends via V2X protocols, demonstrating that roadside edge AI analytics can augment cooperative perception and proactive road safety management within the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles ecosystem.
