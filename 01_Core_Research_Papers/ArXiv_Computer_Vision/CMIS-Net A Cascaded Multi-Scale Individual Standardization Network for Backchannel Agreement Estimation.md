Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like, responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level) to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level). This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection.
