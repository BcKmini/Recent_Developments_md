Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.
