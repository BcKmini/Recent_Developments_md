Abstract: Reliable perception of the environment is a key enabler for autonomous systems, where calibration and localization tasks often rely on robust visual markers. We introduce the PuzzlePole, a new type of fiducial markers derived from the recently proposed PuzzleBoard calibration pattern. The PuzzlePole is a cylindrical marker, enabling reliable recognition and pose estimation from 360{\deg} viewing direction. By leveraging the unique combinatorial structure of the PuzzleBoard pattern, PuzzlePoles provide a high accuracy in localization and orientation while being robust to occlusions. The design offers flexibility for deployment in diverse autonomous systems scenarios, ranging from robot navigation and SLAM to tangible interfaces.
