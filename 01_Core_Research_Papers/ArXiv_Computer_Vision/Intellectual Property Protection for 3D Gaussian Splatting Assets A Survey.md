Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.
