Abstract: The study of histopathological subtypes is valuable for the personalisation of effective treatment strategies for ovarian cancer. However, increasing diagnostic workloads present a challenge for UK pathology departments, leading to the rise in AI approaches. While traditional approaches in this field have relied on pre-computed, frozen image features, recent advances have shifted towards end-to-end feature extraction, providing an improvement in accuracy but at the expense of significantly reduced scalability during training and time-consuming experimentation. In this paper, we propose a new approach for subtype classification and localisation in ovarian cancer histopathology images using contrastive and prototype learning with pre-computed, frozen features via feature-space augmentations. Compared to DSMIL, our method achieves an improvement of 70.4\% and 15.3\% in F1 score for instance- and slide-level classification, respectively, along with AUC gains of 16.9\% for instance localisation and 2.3\% for slide classification, while maintaining the use of frozen patch features.
