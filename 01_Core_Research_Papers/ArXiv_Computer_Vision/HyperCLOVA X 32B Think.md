Abstract: In this report, we present HyperCLOVA X 32B Think, a vision-language model designed with particular emphasis on reasoning within the Korean linguistic and cultural context, as well as agentic ability. HyperCLOVA X 32B Think is pre-trained with a strong focus on reasoning capabilities and subsequently post-trained to support multimodal understanding, enhanced reasoning, agentic behaviors, and alignment with human preferences. Experimental evaluations against comparably sized models demonstrate that our model achieves strong performance on Korean text-to-text and vision-to-text benchmarks, as well as on agent-oriented evaluation tasks. By open-sourcing HyperCLOVA X 32B Think, we aim to support broader adoption and facilitate further research and innovation across both academic and industrial communities.
