Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our "token is all you need" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.
