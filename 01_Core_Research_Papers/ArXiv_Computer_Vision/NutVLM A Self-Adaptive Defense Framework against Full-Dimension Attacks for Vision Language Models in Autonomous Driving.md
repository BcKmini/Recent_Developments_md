Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have advanced perception in autonomous driving (AD), but they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats. These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates "corrective driving prompts" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation. Our code is available at https://github.com/PXX/NutVLM.
