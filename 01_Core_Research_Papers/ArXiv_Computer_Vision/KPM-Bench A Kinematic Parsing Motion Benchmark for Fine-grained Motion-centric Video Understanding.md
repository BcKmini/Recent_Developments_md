Abstract: Despite recent advancements, video captioning models still face significant limitations in accurately describing fine-grained motion details and suffer from severe hallucination issues. These challenges become particularly prominent when generating captions for motion-centric videos, where precise depiction of intricate movements and limb dynamics is crucial yet often neglected. To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models. By integrating MoPE into the GRPO post-training framework, we effectively mitigate hallucination problems, significantly improving the reliability of motion-centric video captioning models.
