Abstract: The dataset spans diverse artistic styles, including regionally grounded aesthetics from the Middle East, Northern Europe, East Asia, and South Asia, alongside general categories such as sketch and oil painting. All images are generated using the Moonworks Lunara model and intentionally crafted to embody distinct, high-quality aesthetic styles, yielding a first-of-its-kind dataset with substantially higher aesthetic scores, exceeding even aesthetics-focused datasets, and general-purpose datasets by a larger margin. Each image is accompanied by a human-refined prompt and structured annotations that jointly describe salient objects, attributes, relationships, and stylistic cues. Unlike large-scale web-derived datasets that emphasize breadth over precision, the Lunara Aesthetic Dataset prioritizes aesthetic quality, stylistic diversity, and licensing transparency, and is released under the Apache 2.0 license to support research and unrestricted academic and commercial use.
