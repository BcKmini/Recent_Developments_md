Abstract: Addressing the current lack of a standardized habitat classification system for cultivated land ecosystems, incomplete coverage of habitat types, and the inability of existing models to effectively integrate semantic and texture features-resulting in insufficient segmentation accuracy and blurred boundaries for multi-scale habitats (e.g., large-scale field plots and micro-habitats)-this study developed a comprehensively annotated ultra-high-resolution remote sensing image dataset encompassing 15 categories of cultivated land system habitats. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-Weighted Feature Fusion Network (DWFF-Net). The encoder of this model utilizes a frozen-parameter DINOv3 to extract foundational features. By analyzing the relationships between different category images and feature maps, we introduce a data-level adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for feature fusion. The decoder incorporates a dynamic weight computation network to achieve thorough integration of multi-layer features, and a hybrid loss function is adopted to optimize model training. Experimental results on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.6979 and an F1-score of 0.8049, outperforming the baseline network by 0.021 and 0.0161, respectively. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary nature of multi-layer feature fusion, which effectively improves the IoU for micro-habitat categories such as field ridges. This study establishes a habitat identification framework for cultivated land systems based on adaptive multi-layer feature fusion, enabling sub-meter precision habitat mapping at a low cost and providing robust technical support for fine-grained habitat monitoring in cultivated landscapes.
