Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in medical AI, enabling collaborative model training across institutions without direct data sharing. This study benchmarks three prominent FL frameworks NVIDIA FLARE, Flower, and Owkin Substra to evaluate their suitability for medical imaging applications in real-world settings. Using the PathMNIST dataset, we assess model performance, convergence efficiency, communication overhead, scalability, and developer experience. Results indicate that NVIDIA FLARE offers superior production scalability, Flower provides flexibility for prototyping and academic research, and Owkin Substra demonstrates exceptional privacy and compliance features. Each framework exhibits strengths optimized for distinct use cases, emphasizing their relevance to practical deployment in healthcare environments.
