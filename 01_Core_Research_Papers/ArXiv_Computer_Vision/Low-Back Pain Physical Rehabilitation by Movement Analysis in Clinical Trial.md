Abstract: To allow the development and assessment of physical rehabilitation by an intelligent tutoring system, we propose a medical dataset of clinical patients carrying out low back-pain rehabilitation exercises and benchmark on state of the art human movement analysis algorithms. This dataset is valuable because it includes rehabilitation motions in a clinical setting with patients in their rehabilitation program. This paper introduces the Keraal dataset, a clinically collected dataset to enable intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for rehabilitation. It addresses four challenges in exercise monitoring: motion assessment, error recognition, spatial localization, temporal localization
