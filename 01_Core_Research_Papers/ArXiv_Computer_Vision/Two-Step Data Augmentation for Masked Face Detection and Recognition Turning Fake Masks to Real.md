Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.
