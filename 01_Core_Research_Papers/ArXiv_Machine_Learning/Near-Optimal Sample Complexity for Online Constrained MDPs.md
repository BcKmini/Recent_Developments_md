Abstract: Safety is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs. For strict feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with zero violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^5}{\varepsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ learning episodes, where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant characterizing the size of the feasible region. This result matches the lower bound for learning CMDPs with access to a generative model.
Our results demonstrate that learning CMDPs in an online setting is as easy as learning with a generative model and is no more challenging than learning unconstrained MDPs when small violations are allowed.
