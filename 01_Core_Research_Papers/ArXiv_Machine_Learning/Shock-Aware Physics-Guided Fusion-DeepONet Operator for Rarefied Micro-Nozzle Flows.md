Abstract: We present a comprehensive, physics aware deep learning framework for constructing fast and accurate surrogate models of rarefied, shock containing micro nozzle flows. The framework integrates three key components, a Fusion DeepONet operator learning architecture for capturing parameter dependencies, a physics-guided feature space that embeds a shock-aligned coordinate system, and a two-phase curriculum strategy emphasizing high-gradient regions. To demonstrate the generality and inductive bias of the proposed framework, we first validate it on the canonical viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits advective steepening and shock like gradients.
