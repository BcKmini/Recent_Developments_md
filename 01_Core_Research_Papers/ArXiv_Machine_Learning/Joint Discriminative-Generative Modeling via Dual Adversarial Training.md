Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.
