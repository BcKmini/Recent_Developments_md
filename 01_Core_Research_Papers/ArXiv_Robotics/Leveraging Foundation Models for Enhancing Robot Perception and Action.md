Abstract: This thesis investigates how foundation models can be systematically leveraged to enhance robotic capabilities, enabling more effective localization, interaction, and manipulation in unstructured environments. The work is structured around four core lines of inquiry, each addressing a fundamental challenge in robotics while collectively contributing to a cohesive framework for semantics-aware robotic intelligence.
