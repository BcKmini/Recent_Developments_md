Abstract: The tactile sensation of clothing is critical to wearer comfort. To reveal physical properties that make clothing comfortable, systematic collection of tactile data during sliding motion is required. We propose a robotic arm-based system for collecting tactile data from intact garments. The system performs stroking measurements with a simulated fingertip while precisely controlling speed and direction, enabling creation of motion-labeled, multimodal tactile databases. Machine learning evaluation showed that including motion-related parameters improved identification accuracy for audio and acceleration data, demonstrating the efficacy of motion-related labels for characterizing clothing tactile sensation. This system provides a scalable, non-destructive method for capturing tactile data of clothing, contributing to future studies on fabric perception and reproduction.
