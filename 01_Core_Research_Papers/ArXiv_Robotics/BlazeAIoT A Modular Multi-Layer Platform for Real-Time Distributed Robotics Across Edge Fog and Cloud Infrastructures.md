Abstract: The increasing complexity of distributed robotics has driven the need for platforms that seamlessly integrate edge, fog, and cloud computing layers while meeting strict real-time constraints. This paper introduces BlazeAIoT, a modular multi-layer platform designed to unify distributed robotics across heterogeneous infrastructures. BlazeAIoT provides dynamic data transfer, configurable services, and integrated monitoring, while ensuring resilience, security, and programming language flexibility. The architecture leverages Kubernetes-based clusters, broker interoperability (DDS, Kafka, Redis, and ROS2), and adaptive data distribution mechanisms to optimize communication and computation across diverse environments. The proposed solution includes a multi-layer configuration service, dynamic and adaptive data bridging, and hierarchical rate limiting to handle large messages. The platform is validated through robotics scenarios involving navigation and artificial intelligence-driven large-scale message processing, demonstrating robust performance under real-time constraints. Results highlight BlazeAIoT's ability to dynamically allocate services across incomplete topologies, maintain system health, and minimize latency, making it a cost-aware, scalable solution for robotics and broader IoT applications, such as smart cities and smart factories.
