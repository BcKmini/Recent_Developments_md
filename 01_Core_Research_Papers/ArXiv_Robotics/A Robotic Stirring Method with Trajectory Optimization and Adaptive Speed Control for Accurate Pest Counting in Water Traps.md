Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle, spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental results show ...
