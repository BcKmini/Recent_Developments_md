Abstract: Robot-assisted endovascular intervention offers a safe and effective solution for remote catheter manipulation, reducing radiation exposure while enabling precise navigation. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for autonomous catheter steering; however, conventional methods suffer from sparse reward design and reliance on static vascular models, limiting their sample efficiency and generalization to intraoperative variations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a sample-efficient RL framework with online expert correction for autonomous catheter steering in endovascular bifurcation navigation. The proposed framework integrates three key components: (1) A segmentation-based pose estimation module for accurate real-time state feedback, (2) A fuzzy controller for bifurcation-aware orientation adjustment, and (3) A structured reward generator incorporating expert priors to guide policy learning. By leveraging online expert correction, the framework reduces exploration inefficiency and enhances policy robustness in complex vascular structures. Experimental validation on a robotic platform using a transparent vascular phantom demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves convergence in 123 training episodes -- a 25.9% reduction compared to the baseline Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm -- while reducing average positional error to 83.8% of the baseline. These results indicate that combining sample-efficient RL with online expert correction enables reliable and accurate catheter steering, particularly in anatomically challenging bifurcation scenarios critical for endovascular navigation.
