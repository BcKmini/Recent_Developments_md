Abstract: In this work, we present a novel control approach based on partial feedback linearization (PFL) for the stabilization of a suspended aerial platform with an attached load. Such systems are envisioned for various applications in construction sites involving cranes, such as the holding and transportation of heavy objects. Our proposed control approach considers the underactuation of the whole system while utilizing its coupled dynamics for stabilization. We demonstrate using numerical stability analysis that these coupled terms are crucial for the stabilization of the complete system. We also carried out robustness analysis of the proposed approach in the presence of external wind disturbances, sensor noise, and uncertainties in system dynamics. As our envisioned target application involves cranes in outdoor construction sites, our control approaches rely on only onboard sensors, thus making it suitable for such applications. We carried out extensive simulation studies and experimental tests to validate our proposed control approach.
