Abstract: Curve-straight probabilistic engagement zones (CSPEZ) quantify the spatial regions an evader should avoid to reduce capture risk from a turn-rate-limited pursuer following a curve-straight path with uncertain parameters including position, heading, velocity, range, and maximum turn rate. This paper presents methods for generating evader trajectories that minimize capture risk under such uncertainty. We first derive an analytic solution for the deterministic curve-straight basic engagement zone (CSBEZ), then extend this formulation to a probabilistic framework using four uncertainty-propagation approaches: Monte Carlo sampling, linearization, quadratic approximation, and neural-network regression. We evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of each approximation method and demonstrate how CSPEZ constraints can be integrated into a trajectory-optimization algorithm to produce safe paths that explicitly account for pursuer uncertainty.
