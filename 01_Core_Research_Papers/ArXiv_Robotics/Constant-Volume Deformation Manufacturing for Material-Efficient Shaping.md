Abstract: Additive and subtractive manufacturing enable complex geometries but rely on discrete stacking or local removal, limiting continuous and controllable deformation and causing volume loss and shape deviations. We present a volumepreserving digital-mold paradigm that integrates real-time volume-consistency modeling with geometry-informed deformation prediction and an error-compensation strategy to achieve highly predictable shaping of plastic materials. By analyzing deformation patterns and error trends from post-formed point clouds, our method corrects elastic rebound and accumulation errors, maintaining volume consistency and surface continuity. Experiments on five representative geometries demonstrate that the system reproduces target shapes with high fidelity while achieving over 98% material utilization. This approach establishes a digitally driven, reproducible pathway for sustainable, zero-waste shaping of user-defined designs, bridging digital modeling, real-time sensing, and adaptive forming, and advancing next-generation sustainable and customizable manufacturing.
