Abstract: Understanding how Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) interact with Traffic Control Devices (TCDs) is critical for assessing their influence on traffic operations, yet this interaction has received little focused empirical study. This paper presents a field dataset and behavioral analysis of Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (TLSSC), a mature ADAS that perceives traffic lights and stop signs. We design and execute experiments across varied speed limits and TCD types, collecting synchronized high-resolution vehicle trajectory data and driver-perspective video. From these data, we develop a taxonomy of TLSSC-TCD interaction behaviors (i.e., stopping, accelerating, and car following) and calibrate the Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) to quantitatively characterize each behavior mode. A novel empirical insight is the identification of a car-following threshold (~90 m). Calibration results reveal that stopping behavior is driven by strong responsiveness to both desired speed deviation and relative speed, whereas accelerating behavior is more conservative. Intersection car-following behavior exhibits smoother dynamics and tighter headways compared to standard car-following behaviors. The established dataset, behavior definitions, and model characterizations together provide a foundation for future simulation, safety evaluation, and design of ADAS-TCD interaction logic. Our dataset is available at GitHub.
