Abstract: Water level monitoring is critical for flood management, water resource allocation, and ecological assessment, yet traditional methods remain costly and limited in coverage. This work explores radar-based sensing as a low-cost alternative for water level estimation, leveraging its non-contact nature and robustness to environmental conditions. Commercial radar sensors are evaluated in real-world field tests, applying statistical filtering techniques to improve accuracy. Results show that a single radar sensor can achieve centimeter-scale precision with minimal calibration, making it a practical solution for autonomous water monitoring using drones and robotic platforms.
