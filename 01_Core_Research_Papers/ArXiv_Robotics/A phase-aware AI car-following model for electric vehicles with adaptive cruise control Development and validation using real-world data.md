Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking. Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains challenging.
To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI (PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in traffic simulations.
