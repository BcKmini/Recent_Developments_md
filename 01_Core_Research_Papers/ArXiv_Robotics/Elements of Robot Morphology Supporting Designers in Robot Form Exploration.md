Abstract: Robot morphology, the form, shape, and structure of robots, is a key design space in human-robot interaction (HRI), shaping how robots function, express themselves, and interact with people. Yet, despite its importance, little is known about how design frameworks can guide systematic form exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Elements of Robot Morphology, a framework that identifies five fundamental elements: perception, articulation, end effectors, locomotion, and structure. Derived from an analysis of existing robots, the framework supports structured exploration of diverse robot forms. To operationalize the framework, we developed Morphology Exploration Blocks (MEB), a set of tangible blocks that enable hands-on, collaborative experimentation with robot morphologies. We evaluate the framework and toolkit through a case study and design workshops, showing how they support analysis, ideation, reflection, and collaborative robot design.
