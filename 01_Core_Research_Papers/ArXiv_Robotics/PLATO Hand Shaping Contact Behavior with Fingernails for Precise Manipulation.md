Abstract: We present the PLATO Hand, a dexterous robotic hand with a hybrid fingertip that embeds a rigid fingernail within a compliant pulp. This design shapes contact behavior to enable diverse interaction modes across a range of object geometries. We develop a strain-energy-based bending-indentation model to guide the fingertip design and to explain how guided contact preserves local indentation while suppressing global bending. Experimental results show that the proposed robotic hand design demonstrates improved pinching stability, enhanced force observability, and successful execution of edge-sensitive manipulation tasks, including paper singulation, card picking, and orange peeling. Together, these results show that coupling structured contact geometry with a force-motion transparent mechanism provides a principled, physically embodied approach to precise manipulation.
