Abstract: General-purpose robotic end-effectors of limited complexity, like the parallel-jaw gripper, are appealing for their balance of simplicity and effectiveness in a wide range of manipulation tasks. However, while many such manipulators offer versatility in grasp-like interactions, they are not optimized for non-prehensile actions like pressing, rubbing, or scraping -- manipulations needed for many common tasks. To perform such tasks, humans use a range of different body parts or tools with different rigidity, friction, etc., according to the properties most effective for a given task. Here, we discuss a taxonomy for the key properties of a non-actuated end-effector, laying the groundwork for a systematic understanding of the affordances of non-prehensile manipulators. We then present a modular tool system, based on the taxonomy, that can be used by a standard two-fingered gripper to extend its versatility and effectiveness in performing such actions. We demonstrate the application of the tool system in aerospace and household scenarios that require a range of non-prehensile and prehensile manipulations.
