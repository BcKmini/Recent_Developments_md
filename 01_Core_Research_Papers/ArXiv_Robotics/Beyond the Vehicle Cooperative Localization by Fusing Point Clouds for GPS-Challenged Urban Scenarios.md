Abstract: Accurate vehicle localization is a critical challenge in urban environments where GPS signals are often unreliable. This paper presents a cooperative multi-sensor and multi-modal localization approach to address this issue by fusing data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems. Our approach integrates cooperative data with a point cloud registration-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The system processes point clouds generated from diverse sensor modalities, including vehicle-mounted LiDAR and stereo cameras, as well as sensors deployed at intersections. By leveraging shared data from infrastructure, our method significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness in complex, GPS-noisy urban scenarios.
