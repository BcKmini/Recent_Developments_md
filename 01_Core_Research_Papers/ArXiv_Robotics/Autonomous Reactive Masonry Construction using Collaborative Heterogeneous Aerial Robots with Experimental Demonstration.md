Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i) a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in autonomous aerial robotic construction.
