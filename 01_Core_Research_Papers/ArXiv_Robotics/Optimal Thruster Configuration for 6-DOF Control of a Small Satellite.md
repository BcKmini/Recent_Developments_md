Abstract: With the growing deployment of small satellites (such as CubeSats, Nanosats, Picosats, and Femtosats) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for targeted applications like imaging, communication, data storage, and rendezvous-docking mission, there is increasing attention on orbit maintenance and attitude control. A common approach for active orbit control involves the use of multiple thrusters, which, when properly arranged, can also generate the required torque for attitude control. Starting from a 24-thruster configuration, this paper presents a set of thruster configurations (referred to as a viable configuration group) that enable full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) control. Further, configuration group that requires minimum total thrust to achieve 6-DOF commands are found among the viable configuration group. One configuration from each of these groups is further evaluated for its attitude control performance through a representative rendezvous-docking mission, demonstrating that even with a reduced thruster count, sufficient maneuverability can be achieved.
