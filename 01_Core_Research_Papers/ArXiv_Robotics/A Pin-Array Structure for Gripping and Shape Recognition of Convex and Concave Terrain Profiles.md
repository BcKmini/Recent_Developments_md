Abstract: This paper presents a gripper capable of grasping and recognizing terrain shapes for mobile robots in extreme environments. Multi-limbed climbing robots with grippers are effective on rough terrains, such as cliffs and cave walls. However, such robots may fall over by misgrasping the surface or getting stuck owing to the loss of graspable points in unknown natural environments. To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure. We demonstrated the mechanism of the gripper and evaluated its grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. Moreover, the proposed pin-array design works well for 3D terrain mapping as well as adaptive grasping for irregular terrains.
