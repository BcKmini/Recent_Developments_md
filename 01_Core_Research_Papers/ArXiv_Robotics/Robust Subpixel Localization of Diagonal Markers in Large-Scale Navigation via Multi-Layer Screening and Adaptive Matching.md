Abstract: This paper proposes a robust, high-precision positioning methodology to address localization failures arising from complex background interference in large-scale flight navigation and the computational inefficiency inherent in conventional sliding window matching techniques. The proposed methodology employs a three-tiered framework incorporating multi-layer corner screening and adaptive template matching. Firstly, dimensionality is reduced through illumination equalization and structural information extraction. A coarse-to-fine candidate selection strategy minimizes sliding window computational costs, enabling rapid estimation of the marker's position. Finally, adaptive templates are generated for candidate points, achieving subpixel precision through improved template matching with correlation coefficient extremum fitting. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in extracting and localizing diagonal markers in complex, large-scale environments, making it ideal for field-of-view measurement in navigation tasks.
