Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with humanoid robots in real-world scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated similar capabilities on quadrupedal platforms, humanoid goalkeeping introduces two critical challenges: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions, and (2) covering a wider guarding range with an equivalent response time. Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous, and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks such as ball escaping and grabbing. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving objects, advancing the field toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic behaviors.
