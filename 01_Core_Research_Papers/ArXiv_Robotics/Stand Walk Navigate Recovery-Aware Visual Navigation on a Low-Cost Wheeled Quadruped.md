Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the obstacle negotiation of legs, yet many state-of-the-art systems rely on costly actuators and sensors, and fall-recovery is seldom integrated, especially for wheeled-legged morphologies. This work presents a recovery-aware visual-inertial navigation system on a low-cost wheeled quadruped. The proposed system leverages vision-based perception from a depth camera and deep reinforcement learning policies for robust locomotion and autonomous recovery from falls across diverse terrains. Simulation experiments show agile mobility with low-torque actuators over irregular terrain and reliably recover from external perturbations and self-induced failures. We further show goal directed navigation in structured indoor spaces with low-cost perception. Overall, this approach lowers the barrier to deploying autonomous navigation and robust locomotion policies in budget-constrained robotic platforms.
