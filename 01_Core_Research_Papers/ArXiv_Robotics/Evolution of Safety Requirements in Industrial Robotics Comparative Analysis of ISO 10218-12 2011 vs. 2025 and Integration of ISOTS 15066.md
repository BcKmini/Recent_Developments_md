Abstract: Industrial robotics has established itself as an integral component of large-scale manufacturing enterprises. Simultaneously, collaborative robotics is gaining prominence, introducing novel paradigms of human-machine interaction. These advancements have necessitated a comprehensive revision of safety standards, specifically incorporating requirements for cybersecurity and protection against unauthorized access in networked robotic systems. This article presents a comparative analysis of the ISO 10218:2011 and ISO 10218:2025 standards, examining the evolution of their structure, terminology, technical requirements, and annexes. The analysis reveals significant expansions in functional safety and cybersecurity, the introduction of new classifications for robots and collaborative applications, and the normative integration of the technical specification ISO/TS 15066. Consequently, the new edition synthesizes mechanical, functional, and digital safety requirements, establishing a comprehensive framework for the design and operation of modern robotic systems.
