Abstract: Intelligent robotic disassembly of end-of-life (EOL) products has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. While machine learning techniques have shown promise, the lack of specialized hardware limits their application in real-world scenarios. We introduce DeGrip, a customized gripper designed for the disassembly of EOL computer desktops. DeGrip provides three degrees of freedom (DOF), enabling arbitrary configurations within the disassembly environment when mounted on a robotic manipulator. It employs a cable-driven transmission mechanism that reduces its overall size and enables operation in confined spaces. The wrist is designed to decouple the actuation of wrist and jaw joints. We also developed an EOL desktop disassembly environment in Isaac Sim to evaluate the effectiveness of DeGrip. The tasks were designed to demonstrate its ability to operate in confined spaces and disassemble components in arbitrary configurations. The evaluation results confirm the capability of DeGrip for EOL desktop disassembly.
