Abstract: This paper presents a combined sliding-mode control and subspace stabilization methodology for orbital stabilization of periodic trajectories in underactuated mechanical systems with one degree of underactuation. The approach starts with partial feedback linearization and stabilization. Then, transverse linearization along the reference orbit is computed, resulting in a periodic linear time-varying system with a stable subspace. Sliding-mode control drives trajectories toward this subspace. The proposed design avoids solving computationally intensive periodic LQR problems and improves robustness to matched disturbances. The methodology is validated through experiments on the Butterfly robot.
