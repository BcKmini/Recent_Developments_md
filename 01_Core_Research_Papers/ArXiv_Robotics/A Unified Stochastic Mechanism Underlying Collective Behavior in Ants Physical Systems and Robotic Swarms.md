Abstract: Biological swarms, such as ant colonies, achieve collective goals through decentralized and stochastic individual behaviors. Similarly, physical systems composed of gases, liquids, and solids exhibit random particle motion governed by entropy maximization, yet do not achieve collective objectives. Despite this analogy, no unified framework exists to explain the stochastic behavior in both biological and physical systems. Here, we present empirical evidence from \textit{Formica polyctena} ants that reveals a shared statistical mechanism underlying both systems: maximization under different energy function constraints. We further demonstrate that robotic swarms governed by this principle can exhibit scalable, decentralized cooperation, mimicking physical phase-like behaviors with minimal individual computation. These findings established a unified stochastic model linking biological, physical, and robotic swarms, offering a scalable principle for designing robust and intelligent swarm robotics.
