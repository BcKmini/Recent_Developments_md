Abstract: When autonomous systems are deployed in real-world scenarios, sensors are often subject to limited field-of-view (FOV) constraints, either naturally through system design, or through unexpected occlusions or sensor failures. In conditions where a large FOV is unavailable, it is important to be able to infer information about the environment and predict the state of nearby surroundings based on available data to maintain safe and accurate operation. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of deep learning for dynamic map state prediction based on limited FOV time series data. We show that by representing dynamic sensor data in a simple single-image format that captures both spatial and temporal information, we can effectively use a wide variety of existing image-to-image learning models to predict map states with high accuracy in a diverse set of sensing scenarios.
